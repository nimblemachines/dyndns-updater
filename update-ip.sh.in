# Get current IP from checkip.dyndns.org, filter out current WAN IP, check
# against cached value; if different, log, send email, and update DynDNS
# (dyndns.org).

# So I'm going to give up the "responsiveness" of checking the IP every
# minute and use dyndns's checkip service, which can't be polled more
# frequently than once every 10mins. Oh well. At least it'll be more
# reliable!

### Configuration

# This is run from cron, so make sure that we can find sed, curl, mail and
# logger.
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# The scripts write a couple of files here.  If you're running from cron as
# a regular user, this directory needs to be readable and writable by that
# user.
cd $scriptdir

# This is whatever you set up when you opened your DynDns account.
#myid="username:userpass"
#myhost="myhostname.dyndns.info"

# By default we use one of the test accounts. Set your real id and host
# above and comment these out!
myid="test:test"
myhost="test.merseine.nu"

# If you want email notification of IP address changes _and_ you have an
# MTA running on this machine, set this:
myemail=
